# CS336-Language-Modeling-from-Scratch
Repo contains the Notes and assignements from CS336 stanford class. Intentions is replicate exercises to get better understanding of LLMs and go beyond just the theoretical understanding of Language Models. This is my attempt at passing CS336 offline.


### What is this course about?
Language models serve as the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP) applications and open up a new paradigm of having a single general purpose system address a range of downstream tasks. As the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and NLP continues to grow, possessing a deep understanding of language models becomes essential for scientists and engineers alike. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of language models by walking them through the entire process of developing their own. Drawing inspiration from operating systems courses that create an entire operating system from scratch, we will lead students through every aspect of language model creation, including data collection and cleaning for pre-training, transformer model construction, model training, and evaluation before deployment.
